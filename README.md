# imobilothon-RASP-

This is the submission of Team RASP for Prototype Submission Round of imobilothon 3.0 by Volkswagen Group Technology Solution India.

Our submission consists of a prototype of our proposed app solution. The app is built on REACT Native and will be connected to cars through this app and with various IOT devices installed in the car. The protype app provides the working interactive UI/UX design of the features listed in our solution. As our project required hardware too we have provided just the interface on which it will work(things like forming group, dashboard etc). The presentation provided along with our submission lists the features of our app and basically how we would make this thing work. 

The ppt has also been added in this repository as "RASP.pptx".
To run this app:
1. Fork this repository and create a offline copy of it.
2. Next change our directory to inside our project folder.
3. Run ___npm install___ to all the neccessary dependencies.
4. To run the app use the command : ___npx expo start___
5. For viewing the app you would require an Android device with ___Expo Go___ app installed on it.
6. After the project runs you would see a ___QR code___ on the terminal which can be scanned to get access to the app in your device through scanning.
7. Else manual connection steps are given in the terminal.
8. You do not need to sign in using any account or credentials in the sign up or login page you can directly bypass the page to move ahead in the app.
